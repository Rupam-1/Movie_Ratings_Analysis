Welcome to the **Movie Ratings Analysis** repository! This project analyzes movie ratings using a dataset containing details about various movies, including their year, duration, rating, genre, director, and actors. The script performs data preprocessing, cleanup, and statistical analysis to extract meaningful insights about trends in movie ratings.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Analyze and extract insights from a dataset of movie ratings.
- **Tools Used**: Python (pandas library)
- **Outcome**: Process and analyze movie data, generate useful insights, and summarize key trends.

## Project Plan

In this project, we will:

- ðŸ“¥ **Read and preprocess** the movie dataset, handling different file encodings, removing duplicates, and filling missing values.
- ðŸ”„ **Clean and standardize** data types and replace missing values.
- ðŸ“Š **Analyze** trends such as:
  - Average and median ratings
  - Average and median duration
  - Top-rated movies
  - Most popular directors and actors
  - Yearly rating trends
  - Correlation between movie duration and rating

## Functions Overview

The script consists of the following functions:

### `read_data(file_path)`
Reads the movie dataset from a CSV file, handling different encoding formats to avoid errors.

### `cleanup_data(data)`
Cleans the dataset by:
- Removing duplicates
- Handling missing values for key fields like `Year`, `Rating`, and `Duration`
- Converting data types (e.g., `Year` to integer, `Votes` to numeric values)
- Replacing missing categorical values with "Unknown"

### `analyze_data(cleaned_data)`
Performs data analysis to extract useful insights, including:
- Overall statistics like average ratings and duration
- Best year based on average ratings
- Correlation between movie duration and rating
- Lists of top-rated and most-voted movies
- Most popular directors and actors

### `final_results(file_path)`
A wrapper function that calls the previous functions sequentially and returns the final analysis results.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You also need to install the required Python library:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

## Usage

### Importing and Running the Script

To use this module in your project, follow these steps:

```python
import sys
import os

module_path = "<**Path where you have cloned this repo**>"
if module_path not in sys.path:
    sys.path.append(module_path)

from <**Directory name where this repo has been cloned**> import movie_analysis_module as module

file_path = "<**Path to the csv file**>"
results = module.final_results(file_path)
print(results))
```
